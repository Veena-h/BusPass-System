🚌 Introducing innovative Bus Pass System, designed to streamline and simplify the process for both administrators and students! 📝
With two distinct modules, our system ensures seamless management and accessibility:
👨‍💼 Admin Module: Administrators have the power to effortlessly add buses along with vital information such as routes and driver details. They can efficiently process bus pass requests submitted by students, ensuring a smooth and secure allocation process. Only requests accompanied by a valid receipt are assigned bus passes, guaranteeing authenticity.

👩‍🎓 User Module: Students can easily register and navigate through our user-friendly interface. They can conveniently select their desired route, fill in necessary details, and await approval in the "Pass Section". Once approved by our diligent administrators, students receive their bus passes promptly, ready for download and printing.

Our cutting-edge technology stack, including Java, JDBC, Servlets, JSP, MVC, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL server, and Tomcat, ensures robust performance and reliability.
